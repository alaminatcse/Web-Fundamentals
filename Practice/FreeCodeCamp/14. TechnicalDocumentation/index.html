            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                    Document Object Model (DOM).</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
                    on a server.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What you should already know</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the
                    main page about JavaScript.</li>

            <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the
                reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

            </p>
            <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime
                system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The
                prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual
                objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can
                be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.

            </p>
            <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types
                are not explicitly typed.

        <section id="hello_world" class="main-section">
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
                code:
            </p>
              <code>
                function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                greetMe("World");
              </code>
            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="function_declarations" class="main-section">
            <header>Function Declarations</header>
            <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The name of the function.</li>
              <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
              <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
            <code>
              function square(number) { return number * number; }
            </code>
            <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the function.

</p>
            <code>
              return number * number;
            </code>
            <p>Here are some coding example: </p>
            <code>
              if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
            </code>
            <code>
              if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
not defined
            </code>
            <code>
              // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR
              function f() {}; const f = 5;
              // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO
              function f() {
                const g = 5; var g;//statements 
              }
            </code>
